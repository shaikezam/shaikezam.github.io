<h3>Threads Intro</h3>
Before we getting started, lets first try to understand some basic concepts:<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Process</b> - An execution of application or program.</li>
    <li><b>Thread</b> - Lives within a process and share its virtual address space and system resources with other threads.</li>
    <li><b>Concurrency</b> - the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.</li>
</ul>
So why we need to use threads? we can have a motivation from a simple example:<br>
Let's image we need to develop 
<ul>
    <li>asd</li>
    <li>sadsad</li>
    <li>asdas</li>
    </ul>
    sadas
    <p>asdsad adsa <code>adsadadsad</code></p>
